This project shows the process of building a document scanner application using OpenCV and Python ,using tools and frameworks (such as Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV). 
The main goal of the project is to create an application that automatically detects edges in an image, eliminating unnecessary parts while enhancing text readability. 
The approach involves image pre-processing using OpenCV, including blurring, edge detection (using the Canny algorithm), contour extraction, and selecting the best contour. 
The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook, covering tasks like image resizing, grayscale conversion, blurring, edge detection, and contour extraction.
